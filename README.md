# Elekit

This is a custom library of tools for manipulating the DOM with the javascript API made simple.

The main idea was to cut down on the amount of code being typed when playing with the DOM. Between having to create an element, apply styling to that element, then populate the element with contnet, my fingers started to get tired!
This isnt to say that the vanilla api is bad, I just felt a simple library could be made to speed the process up.
